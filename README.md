# Firefighting Calculators
Small collection of common firefighting calculators used by IC's (Incident 
Commanders). Coding is all HTML, CSS, Bootstrap with jQuery form validation

No compiling is necessary; just download and open `index.html` in a web browser.

## TO-DO:
* Many more calculators to add as time allows.
